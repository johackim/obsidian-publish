# Obsidian Publish

A self-hosted alternative to [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) with additional features.

## üßê Why?

Obsidian Publish is awesome, but you can't customize SEO, robots.txt, rss.xml & sitemap.xml.

So, I created this project to self-host your Obsidian Publish vault with these features.
